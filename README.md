bgNukes README

# Overview
bgNukes is a tool for launching background renders from [The Foundry's Nuke](http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke/). It is written by [Tim BOWMAN](http://hellothisistim.com).

This script exists because our company renderfarm wasn't alive yet and I was already frustrated with rendering in the Nuke UI and tired of typing out command-line render commands to background the renders. I am sharing it because I'm sure my situation was not unique.

# How to install
Put bgNukes in your .nuke directory (or somewhere else in your Nuke path if you're fancy), then add this line to your menu.py:

import bgNukes

Importing the module adds a "BG Render" item to the Render menu. 

# How to use
Select the Write node (or nodes) that you want to render. (If you don't select anything, that's the same as if you selected everything.) Now select the "BG Render" item from the Render menu. In the panel, tell it which frames and how many instances you want and click OK.

Happy Rendering!

# Details
This script launches a number of command-line render instances in the background and captures their output in log files which are saved to the same directory as the Nuke script. You are now free to keep working in the UI and have your renders happen in the background. 

bgNukes is tested in Nuke versions 13, 14, and 15 on Windows. If you try it on Linux or MacOS, please drop me a line and let me know how it went.

# Stop this crazy thing!!!

Sadly, the only way to stop a render in progress is to close Nuke's command prompt window. I realize this is less nifty than it could be.

# Thank you
Thanks go to Nathan Dunsworth. His localRender.py was (and continues to be) an excellent reference.
